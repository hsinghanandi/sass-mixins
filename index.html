              macOS Monterey was announced on June 7, 2021, during the WWDC
              keynote speech. It is yet to be released. macOS Monterey
              introduces new features such as Universal Control, Airplay,
              Shortcuts, and more. Universal Control allows users to use a
              single Keyboard and Mouse to move between devices. Airplay now
              allows users to present and share almost anything. The Shortcuts
              app was also introduced to macOS, giving users access to galleries
              of pre-built shortcuts, designed for Macs, a service brought from
              iOS. Users can now also set up shortcuts, among other things.

              macOS Catalina was announced on June 3, 2019, during the WWDC
              keynote speech. It was released on October 7, 2019. It primarily
              focuses on updates to built-in apps, such as replacing iTunes with
              separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps, redesigned Reminders and
              Books apps, and a new Find My app. It also features Sidecar, which
              allows the user to use an iPad as a second screen for their
              computer, or even simulate a graphics tablet with an Apple Pencil.
              It is the first version of macOS not to support 32-bit
              applications. The Dashboard application was also removed in the
              update.

              to the user's current time of day.

              several Mac-specific features, like searching for files. It also

              authenticate. iCloud also received several improvements, such as
              the ability to store a user's Desktop and Documents folders on
              iCloud so they could be synced with other Macs on the same Apple
              ID. It was released publicly on September 20, 2016
